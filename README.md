# Habit Builder

An app to help you build positive habits. The app can help you keep track of you goals,
and give you the pleasure of checking good tasks off of a list each day.

## About

The app is pretty simple to use. You create a habit by clicking the add button,
you give it a title, duration, and description. Then everyday you can check off the
habits you have done and the app will keep track of your completion streaks, total times done
and days between the last time done. So that you don't miss checking off any habits the streak only goes up
once you press the "New Day" button in the top right.
